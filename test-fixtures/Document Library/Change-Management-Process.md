# Change Management Process

## Purpose

Defines the process for requesting, reviewing, approving, and implementing changes to production systems.

## Change Categories

### Standard Changes
- Pre-approved, low-risk changes
- Follow documented procedures
- No CAB review needed
- Example: Patching, certificate renewal

### Normal Changes
- Require CAB review and approval
- Risk assessment required
- Scheduled maintenance window
- Example: Application deployment, configuration change

### Emergency Changes
- Bypass normal approval process
- Post-implementation review required
- Limited to critical business impact
- Example: Security patch for active exploit

## Approval Matrix

| Change Type | Approver | Lead Time |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Standard | Auto-approved | 24 hours |
| Normal (Low) | Team Lead | 3 days |
| Normal (Medium) | Manager + CAB | 5 days |
| Normal (High) | Director + CAB | 10 days |
| Emergency | On-call Manager | Immediate |
