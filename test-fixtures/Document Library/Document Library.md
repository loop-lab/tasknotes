## Testing Scenarios

### Generate Tasks
Open `document-library.base` -> click "Generate Tasks" -> mode "Generate new tasks" -> creates task files in `TaskNotes/Tasks/` linked back to each document via `projects` field.

### Convert to Tasks
Open `document-library.base` -> click "Generate Tasks" -> mode "Convert to tasks" -> adds `isTask: true` + status/priority to each document's frontmatter IN-PLACE.

### Duplicate Detection
After generating, clicking "Generate Tasks" again with "Skip existing" should show all items as skipped (no duplicates).
